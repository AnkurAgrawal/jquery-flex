Flex is an idea inspired by the old flash homepage on Adidas.com. Searching google for anything that resembled that effect, lead me to a few undesirable plugins. Saw one person  say it was ["quite impossible"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1945164/how-to-make-silde-like-homepage-of-adidas-com-with-jquery), thought it would be a fun challenge.
